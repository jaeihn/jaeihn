<h3>Reading Notes</h3>

<h3>Repositories</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Java application of <a href="https://github.com/jaeihn/AntibioticResistanceSimulation">Antibiotic resistance simulation</a>. (Pretty cute.)
  <li><a href="https://github.com/jaeihn/FFXIV-Mini-Cactpot-Solver">Python code</a> to determine optimal choice for <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Cactpot">Mini-Cactpot</a> in <a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/">Final Fantasy XIV</a>. (Needs some code cleaning and a better UI, but works like a charm.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Useful Resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I am a big advocate for learning by doing. For people who are just starting out in coding, or preparing for the AP Computer Science Exam, Nick Parlante's <a href="https://codingbat.com/java">CodingBat</a> offers a collection of introductory level programming problems in Java. The completeness of your code is automatically assessed through a series of test cases.</li>
  <li>Eric Wastl publishes coding problems of various difficulties every year in December, a code version of Advent Calendar (= aptly named the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Calendar</a>"Advent of Code"</a>). You are given unique inputs and the website only tests for the corresponding output, so you can use whatever programming language you want.</li>
</ul>
